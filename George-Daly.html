    <h2>George Daly</h2>
      <p>George Daly couldn’t sing well, his friends say, but he loved to
        anyway. His favorite song to sing, according to his friends, was Frank
        Sinatra’s “New York, New York,” even though he hardly knew any of the
        words. “It was a lot of mumbling the parts he didn’t know, and yelling
        the parts he did know,” Maura Barker, a sophomore and friend of Daly’s,
        said . . . Daly was a sophomore molecular biology major and a brother of Pi Kappa
        Alpha. He enjoyed playing baseball and basketball — according to his
        mother, Nancy Daly — and knew how to tear up a dance floor. Freshman
        year floormates thought of him as their “captain,” but, above all,
        those closest to Daly called him a true friend.
